### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.* 

My preference is an App service. I am deploying lightweight APIs. Moreover, app service is cheaper than a VM and I am concerned about scaling, there is no need for a virtual machine
